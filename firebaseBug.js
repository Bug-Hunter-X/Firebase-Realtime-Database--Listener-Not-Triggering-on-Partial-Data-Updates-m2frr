In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time even though I was using the `.on('value', ...)` listener correctly.  The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of how data updates are handled in Firebase's Realtime Database.  My code was structuring data in a way that didn't trigger the listener when specific child nodes were modified. I was expecting a full data update even when only a part of the data changed.
